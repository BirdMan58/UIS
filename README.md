UIS (User Identification System)
We are excited to present the User Identification System (UIS), a project developed by a team of dedicated students from the Cyber Security Department as part of our Database Management Systems (DBMS) coursework.

Overview
The UIS is designed to efficiently identify users and direct them to the appropriate dashboard based on their administrative privileges.

User Dashboard
Upon logging in, users are greeted with the User Dashboard, which displays their personal details. We have also included functionality that allows users to edit their information, ensuring that they can keep their profiles up to date.

Admin Dashboard
For administrators, the Admin Dashboard offers a comprehensive view of all users in the system, in addition to their own details. Administrators have the ability to edit any user's information and can promote users to administrative status when necessary.

Conclusion
We believe that the UIS will serve as a valuable tool for managing user identities and privileges within our application. We look forward to receiving feedback and continuing to improve this system.
